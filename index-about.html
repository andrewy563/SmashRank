        Super Smash Bros. Melee has been a passion for me ever since I entered UCLA. When I first entered, I was a complete new scrub and was more than happy to just be playing Melee, but after a while, I started wanting to give back to the community by helping run UCLA tournaments. The greatest problem I encountered was that of seeding. As one might expect, seeding was one of the most disputed topics in the community. While the standings of the top players at UCLA were pretty easy to figure out, the rankings for mid-level and lower-level players was much less distinct. I realized that at least in our community, seeding was mostly based on gut feeling rather than concrete results. Because of this, I decided to create a website that would record tournament sets and analyze the results in order to create help provide accurate rankings as well as analysis.
